There you will be prompt with the user's profile page. By clicking the blue text labeled "Name" the user's email name will load as well as their temporary profile picture.
The reason it loads this way is so that we can minimize the amount of data that is being sent from Google Firebase.
This helps keep the database free to use. By clicking the "Houses" button, you can view all of the houses. Same with the profile page, you can click the blue text labeled "Houses" to view all the houses. This is the method we will utilize to populate the pages with data.
<br> <br>
Upon choosing a house, you will be able to unlock a navigation bar on the top right. There you can acess some features such as the to-do list styled task management system and the alerts section. Do be aware that the alerts system is not fully implemented due to database issues.
The web application is not fully flushed out. With the navigation bar, one can go back to the profile page or house page and this will disable any home unique features.
